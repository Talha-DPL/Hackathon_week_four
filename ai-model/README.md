# AI Model Directory

This directory contains the AI model weights, training notebooks, and related files for the Art Decor AI project.

## Structure

```
ai-model/
├── weights/           # Model weights and checkpoints
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for training and experimentation
├── data/             # Training and test datasets
├── configs/          # Model configuration files
└── scripts/          # Training and inference scripts
```

## Model Types

- **Interior Design Generation**: AI models for generating interior design suggestions
- **Style Classification**: Models for classifying design styles
- **Color Palette Generation**: AI for suggesting color schemes
- **Furniture Placement**: Models for optimal furniture arrangement

## Usage

1. Place model weights in the `weights/` directory
2. Use notebooks in `notebooks/` for experimentation
3. Configure models using files in `configs/`
4. Run training/inference scripts from `scripts/`
